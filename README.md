# Clothes - Virtual Try-On Chrome Extension

**Clothes** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your online shopping experience by allowing you to virtually "try on" clothing before you buy it. Simply select any garment image, and the extension will overlay it onto your image, giving you a preview of how it would look on you.

## Project Structure

This project includes two main components:

- **Chrome Extension**: The extension logic and functionality can be found in the `/clothes-extension` folder.
- **API + Frontend**: Built using Next.js for backend processing and the user interface, located in the `/clothes-frontend` folder.
